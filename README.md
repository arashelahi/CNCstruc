# CNCstruc
This package enables the calculation of the different structural properties of cellulose nanocrystals, including primary alcohol conformation, unit cell parameters, twist angles, etc.

## Applications
The current version of CNCstruc software is only compatible with GROMACS inputs and outputs, and it has two main applications:
1. It reads the coordinate file (pdb or gro), and extracts the atoms involved for quantification of different properties, e.g., hydrogen bonds, alcohol conformations, etc., and creates GROMACS-compatible index files.

2. Given the index files, and GROMACS output files, this package is used for analysis of the hydrogen bond occupancy, population of _tg_ conformations, etc.
